#API used for the project

OMDb API
The Open Movie Database - The OMDb API is a RESTful web service to obtain movie information

#steps
  -First we have to create a Api key to fetch the movie details 
  - Send all the data request to this URL (http://www.omdbapi.com/?apikey=[yourkey]&) with your api key attached to it
  - then recieve the data and manipulate the data accordingly
  - the project also has a favourite section for that we have used local storage(Local storage allows developers to store and retrieve data in the browser. The data         stored in local storage will not expire. This means the data will persist even if the tab or the browser window is closed.)So even after refresh the fav movies from     list won't wipe-out
